Welcome to my personal blog.

I am a quant in financial industry at New York City with programming as a means of living and a hobby. I received a Ph.D. degree in Physics from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu), and a B.S. degree in Physics from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn).

Once I have been to a drive-in theater where the owner spoke via vehicle radios that the theaters were used to be called as "houses" in the old time. 
As soon as you enter a house, there are certain rules and treats.
In my little house here, you will find my posts on history, society, coding, and more.
